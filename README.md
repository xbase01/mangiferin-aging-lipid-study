# Anti-Aging and Lipid-Reducing Potential of Mangiferin in C. elegans

This repository contains the in vivo and in silico analyses conducted to investigate the effects of mangiferin on lipid accumulation, stress tolerance, and aging in *Caenorhabditis elegans*.

## Overview

- **Model organism**: *C. elegans* (N2 wild-type and aak2 mutants)  
- **Compound**: Mangiferin (glycosylxanthone)  
- **Experimental focus**: Lipid droplet accumulation, motility behavior, heat stress survival, gene expression (hsp-16.2, sod-3)  
- **In silico methods**: Target prediction, GO/KEGG enrichment, molecular docking (AutoDock Vina)

## Tools & Resources

- CellProfiler, ImageXpress, RT-qPCR  
- SwissTargetPrediction, g:Profiler, WormBase  
- AutoDock Vina, PyMOL, LigPlot+
